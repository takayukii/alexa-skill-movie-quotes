[Young Gideon is bullying a young lamb and her friends, trying to take her tickets.]
Young Gideon: Give me your tickets right now, or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt! [shoves Sharla and takes her tickets]
Sharla: Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!
Young Gideon: Baa-Baa! What are you gonna do, cry?
[Young Judy approaches in her police costume.]
Young Judy: Hey! You heard her, cut it out!
Young Gideon: Nice costume, loser! What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?
Young Judy: [unphased] Kindly return my friend's tickets!
Young Gideon: Come get 'em! But watch out, 'cause I'm a fox! And like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey, and that killer instinct is still in our duh'nuh!
Travis: Uh, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced D-N-A.
Young Gideon: Don't tell me what I already know, Travis!
Young Judy: You don't scare me, Gideon!
[Gideon shoves Judy onto the ground.]
Young Gideon: You scared now?
Travis: Look at her nose twitch, she is scared!
Young Gideon: Cry, little baby bunny! Cry, cry... [Young Judy kicks him in the face, shocking everyone, Gideon feels his lips] Aw, you don't know when to quit, do you?
'[Young Gideon retracts his claws and slashes Young Judy's cheek leaving claw marks on it. Then he shoves her face in the dirt]
Young Gideon: I want you to remember this moment, the next time you think you'll ever be anything than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny!
[Young Gideon and Travis leave, high-fiving each other. The children rush to Judy]
Gareth: That looks bad.
Sharla: Are you okay, Judy?
Young Judy: Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. [holds out tickets] Here you go.
Sharla: Wow! You got our tickets back!
Gareth: You're awesome, Judy!
Sharla: Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking 'bout!
Young Judy: Well, he was right about one thing: [puts her police hat back on, as determination spreads across her face] I don't know when to quit!

[Judy is with her parents as she gets ready for the train to Zootopia.]
Bonnie Hopps: We're real proud of you, Judy.
Stu Hopps: Yeah. And scared, too.
Bonnie: Yes.
Stu: Really it's a kind of a "proud-scared" combo. I mean Zootopia! It's so far away, such a big city, and--
Judy Hopps: Guys, I've been working for this my whole life!
Bonnie: We know, and we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.
Judy: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
Stu: And also, bears. We have bears to fear, too. To say nothing about lions, and wolves--
Bonnie: Wolves?
Stu: Weasels!
Bonnie: You play cribbage with a weasel?
Stu: Yeah, and he cheats like there's no tomorrow. You know what? Pretty much all predators, and Zootopia's full of them!
Bonnie: Oh, Stu.
Stu: And foxes are the worst!
Bonnie: Actually, your father does have a point there. It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?
Judy: When I was nine. Gideon Grey was a jerk who happened to be a fox. I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.
Stu: Sure, yeah. We all do, absolutely. But just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you.
Bonnie: And I put some snacks in there.
Stu: This is fox deterrent.
Bonnie: Yeah, that's safe to have.
Stu: This is fox repellent.
Bonnie: Okay, the deterrent--
Stu: [shows Judy a fox taser] Check this out!
[The fox taser unleashes a powerful zap, surprising Stu.]
Bonnie: Oh for goodness sake! She has no need for a fox taser, Stu.
Stu: Oh come on, when is there not a need for a fox taser?
Judy: Okay, look, I will take this [shows her parents the fox repellent] to make you stop talking.
Stu: Terrific! Everyone wins!

[Judy meets two of her neighbors at her new apartment.]
Judy: Oh, hi! I’m Judy, your new neighbor!
Bucky: Yeah? Well we’re loud.
Pronk: Don’t expect us to apologize for it.

[The next day, Judy is doing her meter maid duty again. A parking meter goes off and she puts a ticket on a car. A moose is angry.]
Moose: [grunts] I was 30 SECONDS OVER!
[Another parking meter expired and Judy puts a ticket on a tiny car]
Mouse: Ugh! Yeah, you're a real hero, lady.
[Another parking meter goes off and Judy puts another ticket on another car.]
Hippo Kid: My mommy says she wishes you were dead.
Offscreen Angry Driver: Uncool, Rabbit. My tax dollars pay your salary. [Judy, bummed, goes inside her car and bangs her head on the steering wheel.]
Judy Hopps: I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I am a real cop.

[Judy has volunteered to find Emmit Otterton, much to Chief Bogo's annoyance.]
Chief Bogo: I will give you 48 hours.
Judy: [excited] YES!!!
Chief Bogo: That’s two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
Judy: Okay.
Chief Bogo: But... You strike out... you resign.
Judy: [enthusiasm drops] Oh. Uh... Okay. Deal.
Chief Bogo: Splendid. Clawhauser will give you the complete case file.

[Judy has tracked down Nick, believing him to be a lead in her case. She drives her meter maid cart next to him.]
Judy: Hi! Hello! It's me again.
Nick: Hey, it's Officer Toot-toot!
Judy: Ha-ha-ho, no. Actually, it's Officer Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case.
Nick: What happened, meter maid? Did someone steal a traffic cone? It wasn't me.
[Annoyed, Judy rides up and pulls up in front of Nick, blaring her siren.]
Nick: Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby. I gotta get to work.
Judy: [gets out of her cart with the folder, a notepad, and a carrot pen] This is important, sir. I think your "ten dollars" worth of pawpsicles can wait.
Nick: Ha! I make two-hundred bucks a day, Fluff. 365 days a year, since I was twelve. And time is money. Hop along.
Judy: Please, just look at the picture. You sold Mr. Otterton a pawpsicle, right? Do you know him?
Nick: I know everybody. And I also know that somewhere, there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal. So why don't you get back to your box?
Judy: [her smile drops, then becomes serious] Fine. Then we’ll have to do this the hard way.
[In a split second, there’s a parking boot attached to Nick’s stroller.]
Nick: Did you just boot my stroller?
Judy: Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.
Nick: [scoffs] For what? [baby voice] Hurting your feewings?
Judy: Felony tax evasion. [Nick's smile fades and his eyes widen.] Yeeeaah... two-hundred dollars a day, 365 days a year since you were twelve... So that's two decades, so times twenty, which is... one-million four-hundred sixty-thousand, I think. I mean, I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying. Anyway, according to your tax forms, you reported, let me see here...zero! Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense. Five years jail time.
Nick: Well, it's my word against yours.
[Judy pulls out her carrot pen and plays back Nick's confession.]
Nick: [through carrot pen] "...two-hundred bucks a day, Fluff. 365 days a year, since I was twelve."
Judy: Actually, it's your word against yours. And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor missing otter, or the only place you'll be selling pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria. [grins] It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
[Slight pause]
Finnick: She hustled you! [opens the stroller, laughing hysterically] She hustled you good! You're a cop now, Nick! You're gonna need one of these. [slaps his police sticker on Nick's shirt. Nick frowns] Have fun working with the fuzz! [leaves still laughing]
Judy Hopps: [to Nick] Start talking.
Nick Wilde: [sighs] I don't know where he is, I only saw where he went.
Judy Hopps: Great! Let's go! [gets in her car]
Nick Wilde: [grins] It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny.
Judy Hopps: [annoyed] Don't call me cute! Get in the car!
Nick Wilde: [smirking] Okay, you're the boss. [joins Judy]

[Judy and Nick are at the Mystic Spring Oasis, a naturalist club.]
Judy: OHHHH! You are naked!
Yax: Huh? Oh, for sure! We're a naturalist club!
Nick: Yeah. In Zootopia, anyone can be anything. And these guys? They be naked.

[Judy and Nick have arrived at the DMV, the Department of Mammal Vehicles.]
Nick: Flash is the fastest guy in there. You need something done, he's on it.
Judy: I hope so. We are really fighting the clock and every minute counts. [Judy notices something about the employees] Wait. They're all...sloths?! [The sloths are seen doing various tasks slowly; stamping paperwork, stamping papers, taking license pictures.] You said this was gonna be quick!
Nick: What? Are you saying that because he's a sloth he can't be fast? I thought in Zootopia, anyone could be anything. [They walk up to one of the sloths, Flash.] Flash, Flash, Hundred-Yard-Dash! Buddy, it's nice to see you.
Flash: Nice to... see you... too.
Nick: Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend. [to Judy] Uh, darling, I've forgotten your name.
Judy: Hmm. Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD. How are ya?
Flash: I am... doing... just...
Judy: Fine?
Flash: ...as well... as... I can... be.
Judy: Hmm.
Flash: What...
Nick: [to Judy] Hang in there.
Flash: ...can I... do...
Judy: Well, I was hoping you could run a plate --
Flash: ...for you...
Judy: Well, I was hoping you could --
Flash: ...today?
[brief pause]
Judy: Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us. We are in a really big hurry!
Flash: Sure. What's the... plate...
Judy: 29T --
Flash: ...number?
Judy: 29THD03.
[Flash types in the number on his computer as slow as possible.]
Flash: 2... 9...
Judy: THD03.
Flash: ...T...
Judy: HD03.
Flash: ...H...
Judy: D03.
Flash: ...D...
Judy: Mm-hmm. 03.
Flash: ...0...
Judy: 3!
[Flash is about to type in the last number on the plate until Nick interrupts.]
Nick: Hey, Flash, wanna hear a joke?
Judy: [to Nick] No!
Flash: Sure.
[Judy groans in annoyance.]
Nick: Okay. What do you call a three-humped camel?
Flash: I don’t... know. What... do... you call... a...
Judy: [impatient] Three-humped camel.
Flash: ...three-humped... camel?
Nick: Pregnant! [laughs and elbows Judy; Flash starts to laugh in slow motion.]
Flash: Ha... ha... ha...
Judy: Ha-ha! Yes, very funny. Very funny. Can we please just focus on the task?
Flash: [turns the other way] Hey...
Judy: Wait, wait, wait!
Flash: ...Priscilla?
Judy: Oh, no!
Priscilla: Yes… Flash?
Flash: What... do…
Judy: No!
Flash: …you call…
Judy: A three humped camel? Pregnant! Okay! Great! We got it!
Flash: …a three-humped…
Judy: Please, just...
[Judy growls in frustration and bangs her head on the counter.]

[Judy and Nick are searching a limousine for clues, when Nick finds a glass emblazoned with a "B".]
Nick: Well, now, wait a minute. Polar bear fur, Rat Pack music, fancy cup? [realizes something] I know whose car this is. We gotta go!
Judy: Why? Whose car is it?
Nick: The most feared crime boss in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big, and he does not like me, so we gotta go!
Judy: We're not leaving, this is a crime scene!
Nick: Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here, [opens door] so we're leaving right now! [He turns and sees two polar bears waiting for them] Oh, god! Raymond! And is that Kevin? Long time, no see. And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me? Huh? For old time's sake? [Raymond and Kevin grab Judy and Nick by their throats] That's a no.
[Judy and Nick are sitting between the two bears in a car being driven to see Mr. Big. One of the bears is looking on his smartphone at a photo of him and the other bear trapping a wolf in a headlock and chuckles to himself.]
Judy: [whispering] What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you?
Nick: [whispering] I, um... I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug...that was made from the fur of a skunk...'s butt.
Judy: Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.

[Mr. Big, a crime boss arctic shrew, is interrogating Nick after two polar bears brought him and Judy to his home.]
Mr. Big: You come here unannounced on the day my daughter is to be married.
Nick: Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so... [laughs nervously; Mr. Big gives him a look] Point is, I did not know that it was your car, and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding.
Mr. Big: I trusted you, Nicky. I welcomed you into my home. We broke bread together. Grandmama made you a cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug, made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my Grandmama, whom I buried in that skunk butt rug. [Kozlov crosses his chest in prayer.] I told you to never to show your face here again, but here you are, snooping around with this... [to Judy] What are you, a performer? What's with the costume?
Judy: Sir, I am a co-
Nick: Mime! She is a mime! This mime cannot speak! You can't speak if you're a mime.
Judy: No, I am a cop. [Nick sighs; Judy shows the Otterton picture] And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car! So intimidate me all you want, I'm gonna find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do.
Mr. Big: Then I have only one request. Say hello to Grandmama. [to the polar bears] Ice 'em!
[The polar bears grab Judy and Nick.]
Nick: Whoa, whoa, whoa! I didn't see nothing! I'm not saying nothing!
Mr. Big: And you never will.
Nick: Please! [the polar bears open a trap door, revealing an ice water pit and dangle Judy and Nick] No, no, no, no, no! If you're mad at me about the rug, I've got more rugs!
Fru Fru: [enters the room] Oh, Daddy! It's time for our dance! [sees the polar bears, holding Judy and Nick above the pit; upset] What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding!
Mr. Big: I have to baby, Daddy has to. Ice 'em!
Nick Wilde: No, no, no!
Fru Fru: Wait. Wait! [the polar bears stop again] She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday! From that giant donut!
Mr. Big: This bunny?
Fru Fru: Yeah! [waves to Judy] Hi!
Judy: Hi. I love your dress!
Fru Fru: Aw... Thank you!
Mr. Big: Hm. Put 'em down. [the polar bears close the trap door and put Judy and Nick down; to Judy] You have done me a great service. I will help you find the otter. I will take your kindness and pay it forward. [Judy leans forward and Mr. Big kisses Judy on both cheeks. Nick looks at them dumbfounded]

[Judy and Nick are trying to get away from a savage jaguar.]
Nick: [as Judy holds onto a vine] Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!
Judy: I’m gonna let go!
Nick: What?!

[Nick is telling Judy his story of how he was bullied by prey kids as a kid.]
Nick: I have learned two things that day. One: I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.
Judy: And... two?
Nick: If the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy, there's no point trying to be anything else.
Judy: Nick... You are so much more than that.

[Judy has just finished speaking at a press conference and has inadvertently offended Nick.]
Judy: [relieved] That went so fast, I didn't get a chance to mention you, or say anything about how we --
Nick: [upset] Oh, I think you said plenty.
Judy: What do you mean?
Nick: "Clearly there's a biological component"? "These predators may be reverting back to their primitive savage ways"? Are you serious?
Judy: I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage.
Nick: Right. But a fox could, huh?
Judy: Nick, stop it! You're not like them.
Nick: Oh, there's a them now?!
Judy: You know what I mean! You're not that kind of predator.
Nick: The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent? Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met! So l-let me ask you a question: are you afraid of me? [Judy stares at Nick in disbelief, her nose slightly twitching in fear.] Do you think I might go nuts? Think I might go savage? You think that I might try to...[jumps forward] EAT YOU?! [Judy instinctively jumps back and puts her hand over the Fox Repellent.] I knew it. [scoffs] Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh? [He gives Judy back the application she gave him for the ZPD.] Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.

[Judy, her parents, and Gideon Grey watch some bunny kids running through a nearby field.]
Stu: Hey, kids! Don't you run through the Midnicampum holicithias!
[The bunny kids stop running and move away from them.]
Gideon Grey: Now there's a four-dollar word, Mr. H. My family always just called them night howlers.
Judy: What did you say?
Stu: Oh, Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy. I use them to keep bugs off the produce. But I don't like the little ones going near them on account of your Uncle Terry.
Bonnie: Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts.
Stu: He bit the dickens out of your mother.
[A realization sweeps over Judy.]
Judy: A bunny can go savage...
Bonnie: Savage? Well, that's a strong word. But it did hurt like the devil.
Stu: Well, there's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.
Judy: Night howlers aren't wolves. They're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing!
[Judy races away, then turns back.]
Judy: Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry! Come on!
[Stu tosses her the keys to the pickup truck and Judy jumps in.]
Judy: Thank you, I love you, bye!
[Judy speeds the truck up and races toward Zootopia.]
Stu: You catch any of that, Bon?
Bonnie: Not one bit.
Gideon Grey: Oh, that makes me feel a bit better, I thought she was talking in tongues or something.

[Judy has found Nick under a bridge and tries to reconcile with him.]
Judy: Oh, Nick. Night howlers aren't wolves. They're toxic flowers. I think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage.
Nick: [deadpan] Wow. Isn't that interesting. [gets up and walks under the bridge, while Judy follows him]
Judy: Wait, listen! I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you. [She starts crying.] And after we're done, you can hate me, and that'll be fine, because I was a horrible friend, and I hurt you, and... And you can walk away knowing you were right all along. I really am just a dumb bunny.
[Judy continues crying, until Nick replays her words with her carrot pen.]
Judy: [through carrot pen] "I really am just a dumb bunny. I really am just a dumb bunny."
Nick: Don't worry, Carrots. I'll let you erase it... in 48 hours. [Judy tears up with joy, wiping away her tears] All right, get in here. [when embracing a weeping Judy] You bunnies, you're so emotional. There you go, deep breaths. [Judy begins to laugh a bit as she cries] Are you just trying to steal the pen? Is that what this is? [Judy tries to grab the pen.] You are standing on my tail though, off-off-off-off...
Judy: Oh sorry!

[While Judy and Nick are on their first patrol.]
Nick: So, are all rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you?
[Judy slams playfully on the brakes, making Nick lurch forward]
Judy: Oops. Sorry.
[Nick pulls off a pawpsicle that got stuck to his face from the impact, chuckles]
Nick: Sly bunny.
Judy: Dumb fox.
Nick: You know you love me.
Judy: Do I know that? [smiles] Yes. Yes, I do.
