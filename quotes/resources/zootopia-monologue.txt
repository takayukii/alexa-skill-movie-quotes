Well, he was right about one thing; I don't know when to quit!
You ready to make the world a better place?
You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me "Carrots"!
When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. Turns out, real life is a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations. We all make mistakes. Which means―hey, glass half full!―we all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. So no matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox, I implore you: Try. Try to make the world a better place. Look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us.

It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
[about Bellwether] Do you think when she goes to sleep, she counts herself?

Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song and all your insipid dreams magically come true! So let...it...go.
The world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops. Like you.
