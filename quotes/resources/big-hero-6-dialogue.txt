[First lines; At a Bot Fight]
Announcer: THE WINNER, BY TOTAL ANNIHILATION... YAMA!
Yama: Who's next?! Who has the guts to step into the ring with Little Yama?!
[People in the crowd nervously hide their robots, too scared to fight.]
Hiro: Can I try?
[Everyone turns around to see a fourteen-year-old boy, holding a cute little robot. This is Hiro.]
Hiro: [innocently] I have a robot. I built it myself.
[Everyone laughs at Hiro's pathetic robot.]
Announcer: Beat it, kid. House rules: You gotta pay to play.
Hiro: Oh. Uh... is this enough? [Holds up a handful of money]
Yama: What's your name, little boy?
Hiro: [shyly] Hiro. Hiro Hamada.
Yama: Prepare your bot... Zero.
[Hiro and Yama prepare to fight.]
Announcer: Two bots enter, one bot leaves. Fighters ready...? FIGHT!
[Hiro's robot is destroyed in seconds.]
Hiro: That was my first fight. I-I-- Ca-Can I try again?
Yama: No one likes a sore loser, little boy. Go home.
Hiro: I've got more money.
[He reluctantly places the rest of his money on the plate for a second fight.]
Announcer: Fighters ready? FIGHT!
[Megabot suddenly reassembles itself. Hiro drops his "shy, innocent little boy" act.]
Hiro: Megabot, destroy! [Grins evilly]

Tadashi: Hiro! Get on!
Hiro: Tadashi! Ah, perfect timing!

Tadashi: Are you okay?
Hiro: Yes.
Tadashi: Are you hurt?
Hiro: No.
Tadashi: THEN WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, KNUCKLEHEAD!?

[Tadashi just saved Hiro who was at a Bot Fight.]
Tadashi: Bot Fighting is illegal. You're going to get yourself arrested!
Hiro: Bot Fighting is NOT illegal! Betting on Bot Fighting, that's-- that's illegal. But, SO lucrative! [Holds out a fat wad of cash he won from the Bot Fight] I'm on a roll, big brother! [Throws arms up victoriously] AND THERE IS NO STOPPING ME!
[Tadashi suddenly stops as police cars pull up in front of them.]
Tadashi: Oh, no...

[Hiro and Tadashi walk out of the police department after getting arrested.]
Hiro and Tadashi: [Shamefully] Hi, Aunt Cass.
Cass: [Worried] Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay!
Hiro: We're fine.
Tadashi: We're okay.
Cass: Oh, good. [She grabs them both by the ear and drags them to the car.] THEN WHAT WERE YOU TWO KNUCKLEHEADS THINKING?!

[Hiro sits down at his computer.]
Tadashi: You better make this up to Aunt Cass before she eats everything in the cafe.
Hiro: [Not really listening] For sure.
Tadashi: And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.
Hiro: [looking sincere] Absolutely.
Tadashi: [Realizes he's lying; Exasperated] You're going Bot Fighting, aren't you?
Hiro: There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.
[He grabs Megabot and walks toward the door, but Tadashi stops him by grabbing the hood of his jacket.]
Tadashi: [Frustrated] WHEN are you gonna start doing something with that big brain of yours?
Hiro: What? Go to college like you? So people can tell me stuff I already know?
Tadashi: Unbelievable.

GoGo: [Meeting Hiro] Welcome to the nerd lab.
Hiro: [Chuckles nervously] Yeah. [About GoGo's prototype bicycle] I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.
GoGo: Zero resistance, faster bike. [Removes one of the wheels] But not fast enough. [Throws wheel into a recycling bin full of its kind] Yet.

[Wasabi shows Hiro his very organized table of tools.]
Hiro: [Sarcastically] Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?
Wasabi: I have a system. There's a place for every thing, everything in its place.
GoGo: [Suddenly grabs a wrench, messing up Wasabi's "system"] Need this!
Wasabi: [Freaking out] Hey, you can't do that! This is anarchy! SOCIETY HAS RULES! [Chases after GoGo]

Honey Lemon: [listening to music on her earbuds while rolling a huge ball of tungsten carbide onto a lift, squeezing past Hiro and Tadashi] EXCUSE ME! Coming through! [sees Tadashi] Tadashi! [notices Hiro and her smile grows even wider] Oh, my gosh! You must be Hiro! [shouting because of her music] I've heard so much about you! [removes her earbuds and kisses Hiro on both cheeks] Perfect timing! Perfect timing! [uses the lift to elevate the ball]
Hiro: That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.
Honey Lemon: Four! Hundred! Pounds of it! C'mere, c'mere, c'mere, c'mere! [enthusiastically drags Hiro to a large kit filled with various liquid chemicals at the ready] You're gonna love this! A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt, a hint of hydrogen peroxide [takes out a small hand-held flamethrower and heats up the formula] super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and... [sprays the pink formula around the ball then uses magnetic force to attract it onto the ball] TA-DA! It's pretty great, huh?
Hiro: [not really knowing what to say] So... pink.
Honey Lemon: Here's the best part! [lightly touches the ball with her finger. Instantly, the ball explodes into a cloud of pink dust]
Hiro: Whoa!
Honey: [covered in pink dust] I know, right? Chemical metal embrittlement!
Tadashi: Not bad, Honey Lemon.

Hiro: [Confused by their names] "Honey Lemon"? "GoGo"? "Wasabi"?
Wasabi: [Annoyed] I spilled wasabi on my shirt one time, people! ONE! TIME!
Tadashi: [Chuckles] Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.
Hiro: Uh, who's Fred?
[A guy in a giant lizard suit comes up behind Hiro.]
Fred: This guy! Right here! [Hiro turns around and shrieks in surprise] Ah, ah, don't be alarmed. [lifts up his costume head] It is just a suit. This is not my real face and body. [shakes Hiro's hand] The name's Fred! School mascot by day, but by night... [does several impressive moves with the sign he's carrying] I am also the school mascot.
Hiro: So, what's your major?
Fred: No, no, no, no, I'm not a student. But I am a major science enthusiast. I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula that could turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will. But she says that's "not science".
Honey: I-It's really not.
Fred: Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either, is it?
Wasabi: Nope.
Fred: Well then, what about... invisible sandwich? Imagine eating a sandwich, but everybody just thinks you're crazy.
Wasabi: Just stop.

[Hiro is inspecting Baymax for the first time. He pokes Baymax's back.]
Hiro: Vinyl?
Tadashi: Yeah, I'm goin' for a non-threatening... huggable kind of thing.
Hiro: Looks like a walking marshmallow. [To Baymax] No offense.
Baymax: I am a robot. I cannot be offended.
Hiro: [Examining his eyes] Hyperspectral cameras?
Tadashi: Yep.
Hiro: Huh. [Pushes his face into Baymax's belly, examining his skeleton] Titanium skeleton.
Tadashi: [Correcting] Carbon-fiber.
Hiro: Right, even lighter. Killer actuators. Where did you get those?
Tadashi: Ah, machined 'em right here, in house.
Hiro: Really?
Tadashi: Yep. He can lift a thousand pounds.
Hiro: [Awe] Shut up.
Baymax: You have been a good boy. [Pulls out a lollipop] Have a lollipop!
Hiro: Niceǃ [Takes the lollipop]
Baymax: I cannot deactivate until you say: You are satisfied with your care.
Hiro: Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.
Tadashi: He's gonna help a lot of people.

[outside SFIT]
Tadashi: We gotta hurry if you wanna catch that Bot Fight.
Hiro: [frantic] I have to go here! I-if I don't go to this nerd school, I'm gonna lose my mind! How do I get in?
[Tadashi smiles. Sometime later, in Hiro and Tadashi's room...]
Tadashi: Every year, the school has a student showcase. You come up with something that blows Callaghan away, you're in. But it's gotta be great.
Hiro: [confidently] Trust me, it will be. [Cut to Hiro banging his head on the desk that's covered with crumpled up balls of paper.] Nothing! No ideas! Useless! Empty! Brain!
Tadashi: [jokingly] Wow. Washed up at fourteen. So sad.
Hiro: I got nothing! I'm done! I'm never getting in!
Tadashi: Hey, I'm not giving up on you.
[Tadashi grabs Hiro by the ankles and hangs him upside-down over his shoulders. He begins jumping around the room, with Hiro flopping behind him.]
Hiro: AHHǃ What are you doing?!
Tadashi: Shake things up! Use that big brain of yours to think your way out!
Hiro: What?
Tadashi: Look for a new angle.
[Hiro decides to humor him. He looks around the room from a new angle and spots Megabot. He gets an idea.]

[Today's the day for Hiro to show his invention to get into SFIT.]
Tadashi: Wow. A lot of sweet tech here today. How you feeling?
Hiro: You're talking to an ex-Bot Fighter. Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.
GoGo: Yep! He's nervous.
Honey: Ohǃ
Fred: Ah, you have nothing to fear, little fellow.
Honey: He's so tense!
Hiro: No, I'm not!
Honey: Relax, Hiro. Your tech is amazing! Tell him, GoGo!
GoGo: [Deadpan] Stop whining, woman up.
Hiro: I'm fine!
Wasabi: What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint? Fresh pair of underpants?
GoGo: Underpants? You need serious help.
Wasabi: Hey, I come prepared.
Fred: I haven't done laundry in six months. One pair lasts me four days. I go front, I go back, I go inside-out, and then, I go front and back.
[Wasabi dry heaves. GoGo shakes her head.]
Tadashi: Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.
GoGo: Don't encourage him.
Fred: It's called "recycling".

[Hiro was accepted into SFIT.]
Hiro: I know what you're gonna say: [Imitates Tadashi] "I should be proud of myself 'cause I'm finally using my gift for something important."
Tadashi: No, no, I was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show.
Hiro: Ha, ha, hilarious. [Looks down to find out his fly is indeed down] WHAT?! [He zips up his pants and elbows Tadashi for not telling him sooner. Tadashi laughs.]
Tadashi: [Warmly] Welcome to nerd school... nerd.
Hiro: Hey, I, um, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, so... y-you know, thanks for not giving up on me.

Baymax: [Approaches Hiro after activating in his bedroom] Hello. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
Hiro: [Surprised] Uh, hey. Bay-Baymax, I didn't know you were still... active.
Baymax: I heard a sound of distress. What seems to be the trouble?
Hiro: Oh, I just stubbed my toe a little. I'm fine.
Baymax: On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
Hiro: A zero? I'm-I'm okay, really. Thanks. You can shrink now.
Baymax: Does it hurt when I touch it? [Reaches down to touch Hiro's foot]
Hiro: No, no, no, that's okay. No, no touching. I'm fi--
[He trips over a toolbox and falls backwards into the space between his bed and his desk. He tries to squeeze out but realizes he's stuck.]
Baymax: You have fallen.
Hiro: [Annoyed] Ya think?
[Hiro tries to get himself up by grabbing onto a shelf with toy robots on it. The shelf breaks, and the robots fall on Hiro one-by-one. Each time Hiro says "Ow", Baymax asks him how he would rate his pain.]
Baymax: On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
Hiro: [Irritated] Zero.
Baymax: It is alright to cry.
Hiro: No! No, no, no, no, no!
Baymax: [Picks up Hiro and cradles him like a baby] Crying is a natural response to pain.
Hiro: [Jumps out of Baymax's arms] I'm not crying!
Baymax: I will scan you for injuries.
Hiro: [Firmly] DON'T scan me.
Baymax: Scan complete.
Hiro: Unbelievable!
Baymax: You have sustained no injuries. However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels indicate that you are experiencing mood swings, common in adolescence. Diagnosis: puberty.
Hiro: [Surprised] Whoa, what?!

[Hiro and Baymax are inside a creepy abandoned warehouse. Baymax sneaks up behind Hiro.]
Baymax: Hiro?
Hiro: [Screams] You gave me a heart attack!
Baymax: [Rubs his hands together] My hands are equipped with defibrillators. [Moves his hands towards Hiro] Clear!
Hiro: [Alarmed] STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP! It's just an expression!

[Hiro and Baymax are at the police department reporting the guy who attacked them.]
Officer Gerson: All right, let me get this straight: A man in a Kabuki mask attacked you with an army of miniature flying robots?
Hiro: [Correcting shakily] Microbots.
Officer Gerson: [Typing] Mi-cro-bots.
Hiro: Yeah! He was controlling them telepathically with a neural-cranial transmitter.
Officer Gerson: [Skeptical] So Mr. Kabuki was using... ESP to attack you and... Balloon Man?

[Hiro is sneaking a low-battery and loopy Baymax into his house without his aunt noticing.]
Hiro: Okay. If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?
Baymax: [Loopy] WE JUMPED OUT A WINDOW!
Hiro: No! Quiet! Shh!
Baymax: [Trying and failing to whisper] Shh! We jumped out a window!
Hiro: [Whispering] You can't say things like that around Aunt Cassǃ Shh...
Baymax: Shh...
[Hiro walks up the stairs. Baymax tries to follow and face-plants on the first step, then pops back up]
Baymax: Shh!
Cass: Hiro? You home, sweetie?
Hiro: Uh... that's right!
Cass: I thought I heard you. Hi.
[She walks over to the stairs, where Hiro is casually leaning against the rail.]
Hiro: [Nervously] H-Hey, Aunt Cass.
Cass: Oh, look at my little college man. Oh, I can't wait to hear all about it! Oh, and wings are almost ready.
Baymax: Weeee!
[Hiro does a double take, then quickly pushes Baymax out of sight.]
Hiro: [Whispering] Will you be quiet!
Cass: [Thinking it was Hiro] Yeah, wiiiiings! Weeooh!
[As Hiro desperately tries to bring Baymax up to his room, unseen]
Cass: All right, get ready to have your face melted! You are gonna feel these things tomorrow, you know what I'm saying? Okay, sit down, tell me everything.
[She turns around and Hiro's not there]
Hiro: [Hurrying back down the stairs] Um, the thing is, since I registered so late, I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.
[Loud thud from upstairs, Hiro freezes]
Cass: What was that?
Hiro: [Thinks up an answer] ...Mochi! Ooh, that darn cat!
[He looks down to see Mochi rubbing up against his legs]
Cass: Well, at least take a plate for the road, okay?
[Hiro quickly tosses Mochi up the stairs before Aunt Cass can see him]
Cass: Don't work too hard.
Hiro: Thanks for understanding.
[He walks up into his room.]

[Baymax is wearing his new green armor.]
Baymax: I have some concerns. This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.
Hiro: That's kinda the idea, buddy. You look sick!
Baymax: I cannot be sick. I am a robot.
Hiro: It's just an expression.

[Hiro downloaded Karate skills into Baymax's database so they can apprehend Yokai.]
Baymax: I fail to see how Karate makes me a better healthcare companion.
Hiro: You wanna keep me healthy, don't you? [Hold up a wooden board] Punch this. [Baymax punches the board, splitting it in two.] Yes! [Cut to montage of Baymax using Karate moves] Hammer fist! [Using the hammer fist move, Baymax destroys three boards of wood.] Side kick! [Baymax destroys a large wooden structure with one side kick. Hiro's excitement grows.] Knife hand! [Baymax uses knife hand to destroy more wood] BACK KICK! [More wood destroyed] [overly-excited] GUMMY BEARS! [Baymax gets a bag of Gummy Bears out of the vending machine.] Yes!

[The gang is being chased by Yokai.]
Fred: [examining Yokai] That mask... the black suit-- We're under attack from a super-villain, people! I mean, how cool is that?! I mean, it's scary, obviously, but how cool!
[Wasabi suddenly slams on the brakes and stops the car.]
GoGo: Why are we stopped?!
Wasabi: The light's red!
GoGo: THERE ARE NO RED LIGHTS IN A CAR CHASE!
[The light turns green and Wasabi speeds the car back up.]
Wasabi: Why's he trying to kill us?! [Looks out the car window to Yokai] Um... Why are you trying to kill us?
Fred: It's classic villain! We've seen too much!
Honey: [Trying to stay positive] Let's not jump to conclusions! We don't know he's trying to kill us.
[Yokai throws a car at them.]
Fred: CAR!
Honey: HE'S TRYING TO KILL US!
[The car swerves out of the way.]
GoGo: [incredulous] Did you just put your blinker on?!
Wasabi: You have to indicate your turn! It's the LAW!
[GoGo glares, fed up with the "safe driving".]
GoGo: THAT'S... IT.
[She takes her gum out of her mouth and sticks in on the dashboard, then pushes Wasabi's seat back. Hiro stares at her in slight fear. Her actions mean one thing: It's her turn to drive.]

[The gang is trapped in a tunnel of Microbots with the end closing fast. GoGo slams on the accelerator, speeding towards the closing hole.]
Wasabi: We're not gonna make it!
Honey: We're gonna make it!
Wasabi: We're not gonna make it!
Honey: We're gonna make it!
Wasabi: WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!
Honey: WE'RE GONNA MAKE ITǃ
[The car shoots through the hole, and they all scream. The car lands on the pier, and they're safe.]
Wasabi: WE MADE IT! YEAH!

[Fred walks up to a huge mansion.]
Hiro: Fred, w-where are you going?
Fred: Oh! Welcome to mi casa! That's French for "front door".
Honey: It's really...not.
GoGo: Listen, nitwit! A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us! I'm not in the mood for any-!
[Suddenly, a butler walks through the door.]
Heathcliff: Welcome home, Master Fredrick.
Fred: Heathcliff! My man!
[The others just stand there, mouths agape in shock.]
Fred: Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here. Gimme some! [Heathcliff fist-bumps him]

[Hiro makes a sketch of the bird symbol he saw.]
Hiro: Does this symbol mean anything to you guys? [shows the picture to the others.]
Fred: [Raises his hand] Yes! It's a bird!

[Hiro finds out that Baymax scanned Yokai.]
Hiro: Yes! Ha-ha! I can use the data from your scan to find him!
GoGo: Uh, you'd have to scan everyone in San Fransokyo, and that might take, I don't know, forever.
Hiro: No. No, no, no, I-- I just have to look for another angle. [Gets an idea] Got it! I'll scan the whole city at the same time. I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor. [Gets an even better idea] Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy, I need to upgrade all of you.
Wasabi: Upgrade who, now?
Baymax: Those who suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones.
Fred: Ho-ho! Okay, I like where this is heading!
Wasabi: We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!
Honey: Hiro, we want to help, but we're just...us.
Hiro: No, you can be...way more.
GoGo: Tadashi Hamada was our best friend. We're in.
Fred: [Excited] Ha-ha! Can you feel it?! You guys, do you feel this?! Our origin story begins! WE'RE GONNA BE SUPERHEROES!

[Baymax is testing his flying for the first time.]
Baymax: I fail to see how flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
Hiro: I fail to see how you fail to see that it's AWESOME!

[After Hiro and Baymax's first flight]
Hiro: Wow. That was... That was...
Baymax: Sick. [Hiro looks up at him in surprise] It is just an expression.
Hiro: [Chuckles wistfully] That's right, buddy.

[The gang is flying on Baymax to Akuma Island where Yokai is. Hiro, GoGo, and Honey are on his back, while Fred and Wasabi are holding onto Baymax's arms.]
GoGo: Killer view!
Wasabi: [Terrified] Yeah! If I wasn't terrified of heights, I'd probably love this! But I'm terrified of heights, so I DON'T LOVE IT!

[The team is on Akuma Island searching for Yokai.]
Hiro Be ready. He could be anywhere.
[Suddenly, a twig snaps behind them. They all shoot around screaming, waving and throwing their weapons.]
Fred: EAT FIREǃ EAT FIREǃ
[They cease fire and look to see if they got him, revealing that it was actually an untouched pigeon, which flies away.]
Fred: [Embarrassed] That... was a bird.
Honey: [Also embarrassed] Well, heh, at least we know our gear works.

[Hiro and Baymax are inside the portal rescuing Callaghan's daughter. Baymax is hit by a large pile of debris, damaging his thrusters. It seems all hope is lost.]
Baymax: There is still a way I can get you both to safety. [He places his rocket fist inside the bottom of the pod holding Callaghan's daughter. Hiro understands what he's going to do.] I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care.
Hiro: No, no, no, no, no, wait. What about you?
Baymax: You are my patient.
Hiro: [Trying to stop him] B-B-Baymax, no--
Baymax: Your health is my only concern.
Hiro: Stop! No, I-I-I'm-- I'm gonna figure out--
Baymax: Are you satisfied with your care?
Hiro: No! There's gotta be another way! I'm not gonna leave you here! I'll think of something!
Baymax: There is no time. Are you satisfied with your care?
Hiro: [On the brink of tears] Please! No! I can't lose you, too.
Baymax: Hiro, I will always be with you.
[Hiro tearfully hugs Baymax and starts crying. Baymax hugs him back.]
Hiro: [Heartbroken] I'm satisfied with my care.

Hiro: [Closing narration] We didn't set out to be superheroes. But, sometimes, life doesn't go the way you planned. The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people. That's what we're gonna doǃ Who are we?

[Deleted Scene]
[Hiro is sneaking out of the house with Baymax in his luggage. He opens the window in his room and steps outside, where Fred is there is his mascot costume, holding a grappling hook.]
Fred: [Preparing to throw his grappling hook] Okay...
[He tries to throw it, but it falls. He tries again, this time it lands on his head.]
Fred: Oh, no, no, no-- OW! Ah...
[He tries and fails a few more times, almost hitting Hiro in the process.]
Fred: Sorry.
Hiro: [Annoyed; Whispering] Fred! Will you just chill with the hook?!
Fred: Uh, every great superhero origin story starts with a grappling hook. Even you should know that.
Hiro: [Whispering] Can you just be normal for, like, two minutes?! And be quiet! [He lowers Baymax's luggage down.]
Fred: [Whispering] Oh, good call. Play it stealthy. [shouting] ALRIGHT, HIRO! JUMP! I'LL CATCH YOU!
[Hiro jumps off the roof and lands on Fred.]
Fred: Sorry, I can't see very well in the mask.
[Wasabi walks out of his restaurant, taking out the garbage. He sees Fred in his costume, with Hiro still in his arms.]
Wasabi: What...? Hiro? Fred? Is that a grappling hook?
[Beat]
Fred: No!
[He pulls out a smoke bomb and throws it to the ground. It makes a pathetic "POOF", and Hiro and Fred run off, with Baymax rolling behind them.]
