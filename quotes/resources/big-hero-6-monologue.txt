- Hiro Hamada
[Trailer] People keep saying Tadashi's not really gone, as long as we remember him.
[Trailer] We've gotta catch that guy. But first, you're [Baymax] gonna need some upgrades.
[To Tadashi, sarcastically] Oh, great! I get to see your nerd lab!
[After Tadashi shows him his school] I have to go here! I-if I don't go to this nerd school, I'm gonna lose my mind! How do I get in?
[After flying on Baymax] I am never taking the bus again.
[To his teammates] Listen up! Use those big brains of yours to think your way around the problem! Look for a new angle!
Our programming prevents us from injuring a human being.

- Tadashi Hamada
Shake things up! Use that big brain of yours to think your way out! Look for a new angle.
[Last words; To Hiro] Callaghan's in there. Someone has to help.
[To Baymax, after another failed test] I'm not giving up on you. You don't understand this yet, but people need you. So let's get back to work.

- Baymax
[official catchphrase] Hello, I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
[Repeated line] I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care.
[Repeated line] Oh, no.
I am not fast.
[Repeated line] Tadashi is here.
[Loopy] I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.
WE JUMPED OUT A WINDOW!
[Petting Mochi the cat] Hairy baby! Hairy baaaabyyyy.
[After stopping Hiro from walking off the pier] Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.
[After saving Hiro from falling out of a moving car] Seat belts save lives. [Fastens Hiro's seat belt] Buckle up every time!
[Upon fist-bumping] Balalala!
[During the final battle] Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
Hiro, I will always be with you.

- Fred
[Trailer] Whoo-hoo! Science! It's the reason we know more!
Yes! Nothing is better than free food! Unless it's moldy!
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now, it would be the ability to crawl through this camera, and give you a big hug.
My name is Fred, and it has been thirty days since my last-- HOLY MOTHER OF MEGAZON!
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.
[Testing out his new suit] Super jump! SUPER JUMP! I BREATHE FIRE!
[Seeing Baymax in his new armor] He's glorious!
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!
It's Fred Time.
Super jump...! Gravity crush...! [Gets blocked by the Microbots] Falling hard...!
Hello, sign! Care to go for a little spin? [Escapes a microbot trap by spinning a sign and using it as a buzzsaw]
[Fighting Microbots with spinning signs] Double sign-spin! [He lights the signs on fire] NOW MY SIGNS ARE ON FIRE!

- GoGo Tomago
Welcome to the nerd lab.
Stop whining, woman up.
[Referring to Baymax in his green armor] Uh, why is he wearing carbon-fiber underpants?
[Seeing Fred's mansion for the first time] I thought you lived under a bridge.
[As a battle cry] WOMAN UP! [Destroys a tower of Microbots]

- Wasabi
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask, I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.
Anybody else's suit riding up on 'em?
Fred, I will laser hand you in the face!
[Confronting Yokai] Hey«É Uh, you wanna dance, masked man?
[Attacking towers of Microbots with his laser arms] Ha-ha! These are green blades of fury!

- Honey Lemon
[Meeting Hiro] Oh, my gosh! You must be Hiro! I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU!
Okay, okay, photo, photo! Everybody say "Hiro"!
No, don't push us away, Hiro. We're here for you.
Let's do this, Freddy!
[After using her whole purse of chem-balls to blow up a tower of Microbots] WHOO! NOW THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION!
