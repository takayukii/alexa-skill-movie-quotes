LIST_OF_LISTEN_REPEATS
people keep saying tadashi's not really gone, as long as we remember him.
gonna need some upgrades.
oh, great!
i get to see your nerd lab!
i have to go here!
i-if i don't go to this nerd school, i'm gonna lose my mind!
how do i get in?
i am never taking the bus again.
listen up!
use those big brains of yours to think your way around the problem!
look for a new angle!
our programming prevents us from injuring a human being.
shake things up!
use that big brain of yours to think your way out!
look for a new angle.
callaghan's in there.
someone has to help.
i'm not giving up on you.
you don't understand this yet, but people need you.
so let's get back to work.
hello, i am baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
on a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
i cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care.
i am not fast.
tadashi is here.
i'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.
we jumped out a window!
hairy baby!
hairy baaaabyyyy.
always wait one hour after eating before swimming.
buckle up every time!
flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
hiro, i will always be with you.
whoo-hoo!
science! it's the reason we know more!
yes! nothing is better than free food!
unless it's moldy!
hiro, if i could have only one superpower right now,
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera, and give you a big hug.
my name is fred, and it has been thirty days since my last-- holy mother of megazon!
it's like spooning a warm marshmallow.
super jump!
i breathe fire!
he's glorious!
rocket fist make freddie so happy!
it's fred time.
super jump...!
gravity crush...!
falling hard...!
hello, sign!
care to go for a little spin?
now my signs are on fire!
welcome to the nerd lab.
stop whining, woman up.
uh, why is he wearing carbon-fiber underpants?
i thought you lived under a bridge.
if i wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,
i think this would be the weirdest thing i've seen today.
my brain hates my eyes for seeing this.
anybody else's suit riding up on 'em?
fred, i will laser hand you in the face!
heyǃ uh, you wanna dance, masked man?
ha-ha! these are green blades of fury!
oh, my gosh!
you must be hiro!
i've heard so much about you!
okay, okay, photo, photo!
everybody say hiro!
no, don't push us away, hiro.
we're here for you.
let's do this, freddy!
whoo! now that's a chemical reaction!
the winner, by total annihilation...
who's next?!
who has the guts to step into the ring with little yama?!
can i try?
i have a robot.
i built it myself.
beat it, kid.
house rules:
you gotta pay to play.
oh. uh...
is this enough?
what's your name, little boy?
hiro. hiro hamada.
prepare your bot...
two bots enter, one bot leaves.
fighters ready...?
that was my first fight.
i-i-- ca-can i try again?
no one likes a sore loser, little boy.
i've got more money.
fighters ready?
megabot, destroy!
hiro! get on!
tadashi! ah, perfect timing!
are you okay?
are you hurt?
then what were you thinking, knucklehead!?
bot fighting is illegal.
you're going to get yourself arrested!
bot fighting is not illegal!
betting on bot fighting, that's-- that's illegal.
but, so lucrative!
and there is no stopping me!
hi, aunt cass.
are you guys okay?
tell me you're okay!
we're fine.
we're okay.
oh, good.
then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?!
you better make this up to aunt cass before she eats everything in the cafe.
and i hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.
absolutely.
you're going bot fighting, aren't you?
there's a fight across town.
if i book, i can still make it.
when are you gonna start doing something with that big brain of yours?
what? go to college like you?
so people can tell me stuff i already know?
unbelievable.
i've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.
zero resistance, faster bike.
wow. how do you find anything in this mess?
i have a system.
there's a place for every thing, everything in its place.
need this!
that's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.
four! hundred!
pounds of it!
c'mere, c'mere, c'mere, c'mere!
ta-da! it's pretty great, huh?
so... pink.
here's the best part!
i know, right?
chemical metal embrittlement!
not bad, honey lemon.
honey lemon?
gogo? wasabi?
i spilled wasabi on my shirt one time, people!
one! time!
fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.
uh, who's fred?
this guy!
right here!
i am also the school mascot.
so, what's your major?
no, no, no, no, i'm not a student.
but i am a major science enthusiast.
i've been trying to get honey to develop a formula
that could turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.
but she says that's not science.
i-it's really not.
yeah, and i guess the shrink ray i asked wasabi for isn't science either, is it?
well then, what about...
invisible sandwich?
imagine eating a sandwich, but everybody just thinks you're crazy.
just stop.
yeah, i'm goin' for a non-threatening...
huggable kind of thing.
looks like a walking marshmallow.
no offense.
i am a robot.
i cannot be offended.
hyperspectral cameras?
huh.  titanium skeleton.
carbon-fiber.
right, even lighter.
killer actuators.
where did you get those?
ah, machined 'em right here, in house.
yep. he can lift a thousand pounds.
you have been a good boy.
have a lollipop!
i cannot deactivate until you say:
you are satisfied with your care.
well then, i'm satisfied with my care.
he's gonna help a lot of people.
we gotta hurry if you wanna catch that bot fight.
every year, the school has a student showcase.
you come up with something that blows callaghan away, you're in.
but it's gotta be great.
nothing! no ideas!
useless! empty!
wow. washed up at fourteen.
i got nothing!
i'm done!
i'm never getting in!
hey, i'm not giving up on you.
ahhǃ what are you doing?!
wow. a lot of sweet tech here today.
how you feeling?
you're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
takes a lot more than this to rattle me.
yep! he's nervous.
ah, you have nothing to fear, little fellow.
he's so tense!
no, i'm not!
relax, hiro.
your tech is amazing!
tell him, gogo!
what do you need, little man?
deodorant?
breath mint?
fresh pair of underpants?
underpants?
you need serious help.
hey, i come prepared.
i haven't done laundry in six months.
one pair lasts me four days.
i go front, i go back, i go inside-out, and then, i go front and back.
wow. that is both disgusting and awesome.
don't encourage him.
it's called recycling.
i know what you're gonna say:
i should be proud of myself 'cause i'm finally using my gift for something important.
no, no, i was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show.
ha, ha, hilarious.
welcome to nerd school...
hey, i, um, i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, so...
y-you know, thanks for not giving up on me.
hello. i am baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
uh, hey. bay-baymax, i didn't know you were still...
i heard a sound of distress.
what seems to be the trouble?
oh, i just stubbed my toe a little.
a zero? i'm-i'm okay, really.
thanks. you can shrink now.
does it hurt when i touch it?
no, no, no, that's okay.
no, no touching.
you have fallen.
it is alright to cry.
no! no, no, no, no, no!
crying is a natural response to pain.
i'm not crying!
i will scan you for injuries.
don't scan me.
scan complete.
unbelievable!
you have sustained no injuries.
however, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels indicate
that you are experiencing mood swings, common in adolescence.
diagnosis:
whoa, what?!
you gave me a heart attack!
stop, stop, stop, stop!
it's just an expression!
all right, let me get this straight:
a man in a kabuki mask attacked you with an army of miniature flying robots?
microbots.
mi-cro-bots.
yeah! he was controlling them telepathically with a neural-cranial transmitter.
so mr. kabuki was using...
esp to attack you and...
balloon man?
okay. if my aunt asks, we were at school all day.
no! quiet!
shh! we jumped out a window!
you can't say things like that around aunt cassǃ shh...
hiro? you home, sweetie?
uh... that's right!
i thought i heard you.
h-hey, aunt cass.
oh, look at my little college man.
oh, i can't wait to hear all about it!
oh, and wings are almost ready.
will you be quiet!
yeah, wiiiiings!
all right, get ready to have your face melted!
you are gonna feel these things tomorrow, you know what i'm saying?
okay, sit down, tell me everything.
um, the thing is, since i registered so late,
i've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.
what was that?
...mochi!
ooh, that darn cat!
well, at least take a plate for the road, okay?
don't work too hard.
thanks for understanding.
i have some concerns.
this armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.
that's kinda the idea, buddy.
you look sick!
i cannot be sick.
it's just an expression.
i fail to see how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.
you wanna keep me healthy, don't you?
that mask...
the black suit-- we're under attack from a super-villain, people!
i mean, how cool is that?!
i mean, it's scary, obviously, but how cool!
why are we stopped?!
the light's red!
there are no red lights in a car chase!
why's he trying to kill us?!
um... why are you trying to kill us?
it's classic villain!
we've seen too much!
let's not jump to conclusions!
we don't know he's trying to kill us.
he's trying to kill us!
did you just put your blinker on?!
you have to indicate your turn!
it's the law!
that's...
we're not gonna make it!
we're gonna make it!
we're gonna make itǃ
we made it!
fred, w-where are you going?
oh! welcome to mi casa!
that's french for front door.
it's really...not.
listen, nitwit!
a lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us!
i'm not in the mood for any-!
welcome home, master fredrick.
heathcliff!
come on in, guys.
we'll be safe in here.
gimme some!
does this symbol mean anything to you guys?
yes! it's a bird!
yes! ha-ha!
i can use the data from your scan to find him!
uh, you'd have to scan everyone in san fransokyo,
and that might take, i don't know, forever.
no. no, no, no, i-- i just have to look for another angle.
actually, if we're gonna catch this guy, i need to upgrade all of you.
upgrade who, now?
those who suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones.
ho-ho! okay, i like where this is heading!
we can't go against that guy!
we're nerds!
hiro, we want to help, but we're just...us.
no, you can be...way more.
tadashi hamada was our best friend.
ha-ha! can you feel it?!
you guys, do you feel this?!
our origin story begins!
we're gonna be superheroes!
i fail to see how flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
i fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!
wow. that was...
that was...
sick.  it is just an expression.
that's right, buddy.
killer view!
yeah! if i wasn't terrified of heights, i'd probably love this!
but i'm terrified of heights, so i don't love it!
eat fireǃ eat fireǃ
that... was a bird.
well, heh, at least we know our gear works.
there is still a way i can get you both to safety.
no, no, no, no, no, wait.
what about you?
you are my patient.
b-b-baymax, no--
your health is my only concern.
stop! no, i-i-i'm-- i'm gonna figure out--
are you satisfied with your care?
no! there's gotta be another way!
i'm not gonna leave you here!
i'll think of something!
there is no time.
please! no!
i can't lose you, too.
i'm satisfied with my care.
we didn't set out to be superheroes.
but, sometimes, life doesn't go the way you planned.
the good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people.
that's what we're gonna doǃ who are we?
oh, no, no, no-- ow!
fred! will you just chill with the hook?!
uh, every great superhero origin story starts with a grappling hook.
even you should know that.
alright, hiro!
jump! i'll catch you!
sorry, i can't see very well in the mask.
what...? hiro?
fred? is that a grappling hook?
well, he was right about one thing; i don't know when to quit!
you ready to make the world a better place?
you're gonna wanna refrain from calling me carrots!
when i was a kid, i thought zootopia was this perfect place
where everyone got along and anyone could be anything.
turns out, real life is a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.
real life is messy.
we all have limitations.
we all make mistakes.
which means―hey, glass half full!―we all have a lot in common.
and the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be.
but we have to try.
so no matter what type of animal you are,
from the biggest elephant to our first fox, i implore you:
try. try to make the world a better place.
look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you.
it starts with me.
it starts with all of us.
chief bogo headed out 14 missing animal files.
all the missing animals are right here.
it's called a hustle, sweetheart.
do you think when she goes to sleep, she counts herself?
never let them see that they get to you.
flash, flash, hundred yard dash!
life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song
and all your insipid dreams magically come true!
so let...it...go.
the world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops.
give me your tickets right now, or i'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt!
ow! cut it out, gideon!
baa-baa! what are you gonna do, cry?
hey! you heard her, cut it out!
nice costume, loser!
what crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?
kindly return my friend's tickets!
come get 'em!
but watch out, 'cause i'm a fox!
and like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey,
and that killer instinct is still in our duh'nuh!
uh, i'm pretty sure it's pronounced d-n-a.
don't tell me what i already know, travis!
you don't scare me, gideon!
you scared now?
look at her nose twitch, she is scared!
cry, little baby bunny!
cry, cry...
aw, you don't know when to quit, do you?
i want you to remember this moment, the next time you think
you'll ever be anything than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny!
that looks bad.
are you okay, judy?
yeah. yeah, i'm okay.
here you go.
wow! you got our tickets back!
you're awesome, judy!
yeah, that gideon grey doesn't know what he's talking 'bout!
well, he was right about one thing:
i don't know when to quit!
we're real proud of you, judy.
yeah. and scared, too.
really it's a kind of a proud-scared combo.
i mean zootopia!
it's so far away, such a big city, and--
guys, i've been working for this my whole life!
we know, and we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
and also, bears.
we have bears to fear, too.
to say nothing about lions, and wolves--
you play cribbage with a weasel?
yeah, and he cheats like there's no tomorrow.
you know what?
pretty much all predators, and zootopia's full of them!
and foxes are the worst!
actually, your father does have a point there.
it's in their biology.
remember what happened with gideon grey?
when i was nine.
gideon grey was a jerk who happened to be a fox.
i know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.
sure, yeah.
we all do, absolutely.
but just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you.
and i put some snacks in there.
this is fox deterrent.
yeah, that's safe to have.
this is fox repellent.
okay, the deterrent--
check this out!
oh for goodness sake!
she has no need for a fox taser, stu.
oh come on, when is there not a need for a fox taser?
okay, look, i will take this  to make you stop talking.
terrific!
everyone wins!
oh, hi! i’m judy, your new neighbor!
yeah? well we’re loud.
don’t expect us to apologize for it.
i was 30 seconds over!
ugh! yeah, you're a real hero, lady.
my mommy says she wishes you were dead.
uncool, rabbit.
my tax dollars pay your salary.
i am a real cop.
i will give you 48 hours.
that’s two days to find emmitt otterton.
but... you strike out...
you resign.
okay. deal.
splendid.
clawhauser will give you the complete case file.
hi! hello!
it's me again.
hey, it's officer toot-toot!
ha-ha-ho, no.
actually, it's officer hopps, and i'm here to ask you some questions about a case.
what happened, meter maid?
did someone steal a traffic cone?
it wasn't me.
hey, carrots, you're gonna wake the baby.
i gotta get to work.
this is important, sir.
i think your ten dollars worth of pawpsicles can wait.
ha! i make two-hundred bucks a day, fluff.
365 days a year, since i was twelve.
and time is money.
hop along.
please, just look at the picture.
you sold mr.
otterton a pawpsicle, right?
do you know him?
i know everybody.
and i also know that somewhere, there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal.
so why don't you get back to your box?
fine. then we’ll have to do this the hard way.
did you just boot my stroller?
nicholas wilde, you are under arrest.
hurting your feewings?
felony tax evasion.
yeeeaah...
two-hundred dollars a day, 365 days a year since you were twelve...
so that's two decades, so times twenty, which is...
one-million four-hundred sixty-thousand, i think.
i mean, i am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying.
anyway, according to your tax forms, you reported, let me see here...zero!
unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense.
five years jail time.
well, it's my word against yours.
...two-hundred bucks a day, fluff.
actually, it's your word against yours.
and if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor missing otter,
or the only place you'll be selling pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria.
she hustled you!
start talking.
i don't know where he is, i only saw where he went.
great! let's go!
it's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny.
don't call me cute!
get in the car!
ohhhh! you are naked!
huh? oh, for sure!
we're a naturalist club!
yeah. in zootopia, anyone can be anything.
and these guys?
they be naked.
flash is the fastest guy in there.
you need something done, he's on it.
i hope so.
we are really fighting the clock and every minute counts.
you said this was gonna be quick!
what? are you saying that because he's a sloth he can't be fast?
i thought in zootopia, anyone could be anything.
flash, flash, hundred-yard-dash!
buddy, it's nice to see you.
nice to...
see you...
hey, flash, i'd love you to meet my friend.
uh, darling, i've forgotten your name.
hmm. officer judy hopps, zpd.
how are ya?
i am... doing...
...as well...
as... i can...
hang in there.
...can i...
well, i was hoping you could run a plate --
...for you...
well, i was hoping you could --
well, i was hoping you could run a plate for us.
we are in a really big hurry!
sure. what's the...
...number?
mm-hmm. 03.
hey, flash, wanna hear a joke?
okay. what do you call a three-humped camel?
i don’t...
know. what...
do... you call...
three-humped camel.
...three-humped...
ha... ha...
ha-ha! yes, very funny.
very funny.
can we please just focus on the task?
wait, wait, wait!
...priscilla?
yes… flash?
what... do…
…you call…
a three humped camel?
pregnant!
okay! great!
we got it!
…a three-humped…
please, just...
well, now, wait a minute.
polar bear fur, rat pack music, fancy cup?
i know whose car this is.
we gotta go!
why? whose car is it?
the most feared crime boss in tundratown.
they call him mr.
big, and he does not like me, so we gotta go!
we're not leaving, this is a crime scene!
well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if mr.
big finds me here,  that's a no.
what did you do that made mr.
big so mad at you?
i, um... i may have sold him a very expensive wool rug...
that was made from the fur of a skunk...'s butt.
oh, sweet cheese and crackers.
you come here unannounced on the day my daughter is to be married.
well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so...
point is, i did not know that it was your car,
and i certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding.
i trusted you, nicky.
i welcomed you into my home.
we broke bread together.
grandmama made you a cannoli.
and how did you repay my generosity?
with a rug, made from the butt of a skunk.
a skunk butt rug.
you disrespected me.
you disrespected my grandmama, whom i buried in that skunk butt rug.
what are you, a performer?
what's with the costume?
sir, i am a co-
mime! she is a mime!
this mime cannot speak!
you can't speak if you're a mime.
no, i am a cop.
and i'm on the emmitt otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car!
so intimidate me all you want,
i'm gonna find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing i do.
then i have only one request.
say hello to grandmama.
whoa, whoa, whoa!
i didn't see nothing!
i'm not saying nothing!
and you never will.
please!  no, no, no, no, no!
if you're mad at me about the rug, i've got more rugs!
what did we say?
no icing anyone at my wedding!
i have to baby, daddy has to.
no, no, no!
wait. wait!
she's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!
from that giant donut!
this bunny?
yeah!  hi!
hi. i love your dress!
aw... thank you!
hm. put 'em down.
rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!
i’m gonna let go!
i have learned two things that day.
one: i was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.
and... two?
if the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy,
there's no point trying to be anything else.
nick... you are so much more than that.
that went so fast, i didn't get a chance to mention you, or say anything about how we --
oh, i think you said plenty.
what do you mean?
clearly there's a biological component?
these predators may be reverting back to their primitive savage ways?
are you serious?
i just stated the facts of the case.
i mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage.
right. but a fox could, huh?
nick, stop it!
you're not like them.
oh, there's a them now?!
you know what i mean!
you're not that kind of predator.
the kind that needs to be muzzled?
the kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent?
yeah, don't think i didn't notice that little item the first time we met!
so l-let me ask you a question:
are you afraid of me?
probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.
hey, kids!
don't you run through the midnicampum holicithias!
now there's a four-dollar word, mr.
h. my family always just called them night howlers.
what did you say?
oh, gid's talking about those flowers, judy.
i use them to keep bugs off the produce.
but i don't like the little ones going near them on account of your uncle terry.
yeah, terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts.
he bit the dickens out of your mother.
a bunny can go savage...
savage? well, that's a strong word.
but it did hurt like the devil.
well, there's a sizable divot in your arm.
i'd call that savage.
night howlers aren't wolves.
they're flowers.
the flowers are making the predators go savage.
that's it!
that's what i've been missing!
keys! keys!
keys! hurry!
thank you, i love you, bye!
you catch any of that, bon?
not one bit.
oh, that makes me feel a bit better, i thought she was talking in tongues or something.
oh, nick.
they're toxic flowers.
i think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage.
wait, listen!
i know you'll never forgive me.
and i don't blame you.
i wouldn't forgive me either.
i was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded.
but predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes.
i have to fix this, but i can't do it without you.
and after we're done, you can hate me, and that'll be fine,
because i was a horrible friend, and i hurt you, and...
and you can walk away knowing you were right all along.
i really am just a dumb bunny.
don't worry, carrots.
i'll let you erase it...
in 48 hours.
you are standing on my tail though, off-off-off-off...
so, are all rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you?
oops. sorry.
sly bunny.
you know you love me.
do i know that?
yes. yes, i do.
