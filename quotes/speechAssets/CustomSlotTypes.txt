on a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
i cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care.
i am not fast.
tadashi is here.
i'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.
we jumped out a window!

flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
hiro, i will always be with you.
whoo-hoo!
science! it's the reason we know more!
yes! nothing is better than free food!
unless it's moldy!
hiro, if i could have only one superpower right now, it would be the ability to crawl through this camera, and give you a big hug.

it's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

hello, sign!

now my signs are on fire!
welcome to the nerd lab.
stop whining, woman up.
uh, why is he wearing carbon-fiber underpants?
i thought you lived under a bridge.
if i wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask, i think this would be the weirdest thing i've seen today.
my brain hates my eyes for seeing this.
anybody else's suit riding up on 'em?
fred, i will laser hand you in the face!
heyǃ uh, you wanna dance, masked man?
ha-ha! these are green blades of fury!
oh, my gosh!
you must be hiro!
i've heard so much about you!
okay, okay, photo, photo!
everybody say hiro!
no, don't push us away, hiro.
we're here for you.
let's do this, freddy!
whoo! now that's a chemical reaction!
the winner, by total annihilation...
who's next?!
who has the guts to step into the ring with little yama?!
can i try?
i have a robot.
i built it myself.
beat it, kid.
house rules:
you gotta pay to play.
oh. uh...
is this enough?
what's your name, little boy?
hiro. hiro hamada.
prepare your bot...
two bots enter, one bot leaves.
fighters ready...?
that was my first fight.
i-i-- ca-can i try again?
no one likes a sore loser, little boy.
i've got more money.
fighters ready?
megabot, destroy!
hiro! get on!
tadashi! ah, perfect timing!
are you okay?
are you hurt?
then what were you thinking, knucklehead!?
bot fighting is illegal.
you're going to get yourself arrested!
bot fighting is not illegal!
betting on bot fighting, that's-- that's illegal.
but, so lucrative!
and there is no stopping me!
hi, aunt cass.
are you guys okay?
tell me you're okay!
we're fine.
we're okay.
oh, good.
then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?!
you better make this up to aunt cass before she eats everything in the cafe.
and i hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.
absolutely.
you're going bot fighting, aren't you?
there's a fight across town.
if i book, i can still make it.
when are you gonna start doing something with that big brain of yours?
what? go to college like you?
so people can tell me stuff i already know?
unbelievable.
i've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.
zero resistance, faster bike.
wow. how do you find anything in this mess?
i have a system.
there's a place for every thing, everything in its place.
need this!
that's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.
four! hundred!
pounds of it!
c'mere, c'mere, c'mere, c'mere!
ta-da! it's pretty great, huh?
so... pink.
here's the best part!
i know, right?
chemical metal embrittlement!
not bad, honey lemon.
honey lemon?
gogo? wasabi?
i spilled wasabi on my shirt one time, people!
one! time!
fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.
uh, who's fred?
this guy!
right here!
i am also the school mascot.
so, what's your major?
no, no, no, no, i'm not a student.
but i am a major science enthusiast.
i've been trying to get honey to develop a formula that could turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.
but she says that's not science.
i-it's really not.
yeah, and i guess the shrink ray i asked wasabi for isn't science either, is it?
well then, what about...
invisible sandwich?
imagine eating a sandwich, but everybody just thinks you're crazy.
just stop.
yeah, i'm goin' for a non-threatening...
huggable kind of thing.
looks like a walking marshmallow.
no offense.
i am a robot.
i cannot be offended.
hyperspectral cameras?
huh.  titanium skeleton.
carbon-fiber.
right, even lighter.
killer actuators.
where did you get those?
ah, machined 'em right here, in house.
yep. he can lift a thousand pounds.
you have been a good boy.
have a lollipop!
i cannot deactivate until you say:
you are satisfied with your care.
well then, i'm satisfied with my care.
he's gonna help a lot of people.
we gotta hurry if you wanna catch that bot fight.
every year, the school has a student showcase.
you come up with something that blows callaghan away, you're in.
but it's gotta be great.
nothing! no ideas!
useless! empty!
wow. washed up at fourteen.
i got nothing!
i'm done!
i'm never getting in!
hey, i'm not giving up on you.
ahhǃ what are you doing?!
wow. a lot of sweet tech here today.
how you feeling?
you're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
takes a lot more than this to rattle me.
yep! he's nervous.
ah, you have nothing to fear, little fellow.
he's so tense!
no, i'm not!
relax, hiro.
your tech is amazing!
tell him, gogo!
what do you need, little man?
deodorant?
breath mint?
fresh pair of underpants?
underpants?
you need serious help.
hey, i come prepared.
i haven't done laundry in six months.
one pair lasts me four days.
i go front, i go back, i go inside-out, and then, i go front and back.
wow. that is both disgusting and awesome.
don't encourage him.
it's called recycling.
i know what you're gonna say:
i should be proud of myself 'cause i'm finally using my gift for something important.
no, no, i was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show.
ha, ha, hilarious.
welcome to nerd school...
hey, i, um, i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, so...
y-you know, thanks for not giving up on me.
hello. i am baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
uh, hey. bay-baymax, i didn't know you were still...
i heard a sound of distress.
what seems to be the trouble?
oh, i just stubbed my toe a little.
a zero? i'm-i'm okay, really.
thanks. you can shrink now.
does it hurt when i touch it?
no, no, no, that's okay.
no, no touching.
you have fallen.
it is alright to cry.
no! no, no, no, no, no!
crying is a natural response to pain.
i'm not crying!
i will scan you for injuries.
don't scan me.
scan complete.
unbelievable!
you have sustained no injuries.
however, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels indicate that you are experiencing mood swings, common in adolescence.
diagnosis:
whoa, what?!
you gave me a heart attack!
stop, stop, stop, stop!
it's just an expression!
all right, let me get this straight:
a man in a kabuki mask attacked you with an army of miniature flying robots?
microbots.
mi-cro-bots.
yeah! he was controlling them telepathically with a neural-cranial transmitter.
so mr. kabuki was using...
esp to attack you and...
balloon man?
okay. if my aunt asks, we were at school all day.
no! quiet!
shh! we jumped out a window!
you can't say things like that around aunt cassǃ shh...
hiro? you home, sweetie?
uh... that's right!
i thought i heard you.
h-hey, aunt cass.
oh, look at my little college man.
oh, i can't wait to hear all about it!
oh, and wings are almost ready.
will you be quiet!
yeah, wiiiiings!
all right, get ready to have your face melted!
you are gonna feel these things tomorrow, you know what i'm saying?
okay, sit down, tell me everything.
um, the thing is, since i registered so late, i've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.
what was that?
...mochi!
ooh, that darn cat!
well, at least take a plate for the road, okay?
don't work too hard.
thanks for understanding.
i have some concerns.
this armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.
that's kinda the idea, buddy.
you look sick!
i cannot be sick.
it's just an expression.
i fail to see how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.
you wanna keep me healthy, don't you?
that mask...
the black suit-- we're under attack from a super-villain, people!
i mean, how cool is that?!
i mean, it's scary, obviously, but how cool!
why are we stopped?!
the light's red!
there are no red lights in a car chase!
why's he trying to kill us?!
um... why are you trying to kill us?
it's classic villain!
we've seen too much!
let's not jump to conclusions!
we don't know he's trying to kill us.
he's trying to kill us!
did you just put your blinker on?!
you have to indicate your turn!
it's the law!
that's...
we're not gonna make it!
we're gonna make it!
we're gonna make itǃ
we made it!
fred, w-where are you going?
oh! welcome to mi casa!
that's french for front door.
it's really...not.
listen, nitwit!
a lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us!
i'm not in the mood for any-!
welcome home, master fredrick.
heathcliff!
come on in, guys.
we'll be safe in here.
gimme some!
does this symbol mean anything to you guys?
yes! it's a bird!
yes! ha-ha!
i can use the data from your scan to find him!
uh, you'd have to scan everyone in san fransokyo, and that might take, i don't know, forever.
no. no, no, no, i-- i just have to look for another angle.
actually, if we're gonna catch this guy, i need to upgrade all of you.
upgrade who, now?
those who suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones.
ho-ho! okay, i like where this is heading!
we can't go against that guy!
we're nerds!
hiro, we want to help, but we're just...us.
no, you can be...way more.
tadashi hamada was our best friend.
ha-ha! can you feel it?!
you guys, do you feel this?!
our origin story begins!
we're gonna be superheroes!
i fail to see how flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
i fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!
wow. that was...
that was...
sick.  it is just an expression.
that's right, buddy.
killer view!
yeah! if i wasn't terrified of heights, i'd probably love this!
but i'm terrified of heights, so i don't love it!
eat fireǃ eat fireǃ
that... was a bird.
well, heh, at least we know our gear works.
there is still a way i can get you both to safety.
no, no, no, no, no, wait.
what about you?
you are my patient.
b-b-baymax, no--
your health is my only concern.
stop! no, i-i-i'm-- i'm gonna figure out--
are you satisfied with your care?
no! there's gotta be another way!
i'm not gonna leave you here!
i'll think of something!
there is no time.
please! no!
i can't lose you, too.
i'm satisfied with my care.
we didn't set out to be superheroes.
but, sometimes, life doesn't go the way you planned.
the good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people.
that's what we're gonna doǃ who are we?
oh, no, no, no-- ow!
fred! will you just chill with the hook?!
uh, every great superhero origin story starts with a grappling hook.
even you should know that.
alright, hiro!
jump! i'll catch you!
sorry, i can't see very well in the mask.
what...? hiro?
fred? is that a grappling hook?
